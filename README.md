# Lua Trials

First steps and trials with Lua, for personal reference.

## About Lua

- a script language first created in 1993
- designed for extension (expose domain functions)
  and embedding (add it to your app)
- syntax resembles Pascal, semantics resemble Scheme
- “mechanisms instead of policies” -- Lua offers
  exactly one mechanism for each major aspect of
  programming:
  - data -- tables
  - abstraction -- functions
  - control -- coroutines
- written in ANSI C, very small (29k sloc)
- License: MIT
